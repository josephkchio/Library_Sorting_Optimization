-3 trips to A3 (lots of motion waste)
-only 1 trip to C2 (remove diagonal route?)
-A4 is very far away...can move to C1?
-recycle also far...move to C3?
-only A3 books need labels...well maybe others later on...keep in center

Optimization Layout Options:

1. NFIC (A3) → A2, FIC (A2) → A3, RCYC (B4) → C1
2. NFIC (A3) → A2, FIC (A2) → A3, FANT (A4) → A3, FIC (A3) → A4

Choose Option 1: reduce to 20 steps while Option 2 only reduces to 22 steps

Even more effective optimization (batching 3/trip using Option 1 layout mod):
*BookID combinations*
-combine B1 & B8
-combine B2, B5, & B7
-combine B10, B3, & B4
-combine B6 & B9
